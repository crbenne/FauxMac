This repository contains the instructions for building a Faux [Compact Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Macintosh). The model is meant to evoke the feel of an early Macintosh, but is not an exact replica of any specific model. It has mounting spots for a Raspberry Pi, display, and associated hardware that allow you to run a Macintosh emulator and get the 1980's Mac experience experience.

There are two Mac emulators that I have tried and they are [packaged together on GitHub](https://github.com/kanjitalk755/macemu/tree/master): Basilisk II and SheepShaver. The latter will emulate PowerPC versions of the Mac. I tend to use the former (Basilisk II), and the instructions will refer to it.

Take a look at a [short video](https://youtu.be/NNNNNN) of the model in operation.

**[INSTRUCTIONS](Instructions.md)**: This document desribes how to print, assemble, wire, and prepare software for FauxMac.

***THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS***: The documentation on required electronics, wiring, and software setup is not complete. At this point you should consider yourself an alpha-tester!

The STL files for FauxMac can be found on [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/NNNNNNN).

***This model may not be used for commercial purposes as noted in the license***.

## Potential Future Work

* **Audio**: Add an internal audio amp and speaker. At the moment you should be able to use a bluetooth speaker or headphones, but this is untested.
* **External HDMI Connector**: It might be nice to be able to display on a larger screen when demonstrating the mac emulator to a group of people. When using a Pi 4 or 5, the secondary HDMI port could go to an HDMI connector on the back panel.
* **Face Decal**: It would be nice to have a decal on the face the reflects your favorite Mac model (even though FauxMac is not a recreation of any particular Mac). Here's an example of an SE/30 decal I'm making.
